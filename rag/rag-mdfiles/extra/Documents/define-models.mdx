title: Define Models
description: "Try a new model with a few lines of code"
---

AI models are a core resource for inferencing.
The `models` object in the [project manifest](/manifest) allows you to easily define models, whether hosted by Hypermode or another host.

```json hypermode.json
{
  "models": {
    "sentiment-classifier": {
      "task": "classification",
      "sourceModel": "distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english",
      "provider": "hugging-face",
      "host": "hypermode"
    }
  }
}
```

Each model requires a unique name, specified as a key, containing only alphanumeric characters and hyphens.

## Properties

<ResponseField name="task" type="string" required>
  Training intent of the model. Currently, must be one of: `classification`,
  `embedding`, or `generation`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="sourceModel" type="string" required>
  Original relative path of the model within the provider's repository.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="provider" type="string" required>
  Organization or directory that provided the source model, such as
  `hugging-face` or `openai`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="host" type="string" required>
  Host for the model instance.

- Specify `"hypermode"` for models that are automatically deployed by Hypermode.
- Otherwise, specify a name that matches a host defined in the [`hosts`](/define-hosts) section of the manifest.

</ResponseField>

## Auto-deployed models

When using `hugging-face` as the `provider` and `hypermode` as the `host`, Hypermode automatically deploys a dedicated
instance of the defined `sourceModel` when deploying your project. Your project's functions securely connect to the
hosted model, with no further configuration required.
